# CadQuery Play Area!

This is my personal little repo for playing with CadQuery 2.0 where I make simple designs as I learn.  Most of these have some household use or another.

### bunk_clip.py

An elongated C shape clip that holds together two 1" tubes. It's for some portable cots we have in our house. They're designed to be tied together for storage but when you untie them in a house with 4 cats you'll never find the strings if you leave them hanging on the cot. So, when they went missing I printed these. Also makes a handy carrying handle!


### gaskey.py

A key/wrench for turning off floor mounted gas valve. Designed to be slightly larger than 5/16th of an inch on each side of the square opening with a bit of a chamfer to make it easier to get onto the valve. I found a 1/4" version on Thingiverse, it didn't work for me, so I designed my own.
